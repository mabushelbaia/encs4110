## Examples

### Polling ADC
<<< @/snippets/adc/example1.c

### Interrupt-Driven ADC
<<< @/snippets/adc/example2.c

---

## Tasks

### Task 1: LED Control Based on ADC Value
Modify the polling example so that:
   - RED LED ON only when ADC value > 1000
   - GREEN LED ON only when ADC value <= 1000

### Task 2: Display ADC Value and Voltage on LCD
Modify the interrupt-based example so both raw value and computed voltage are displayed on the LCD in the form:
```
ADC: 767
Voltage: 2.474
```
