## Examples
This section demonstrates how to configure and use the ADC module on the TM4C123 microcontroller using both polling and interrupt-driven sampling methods. A potentiometer is used as a controllable analog input source by wiring its terminals to 3.3 V and ground, with the adjustable rotor connected to an ADC input such as AIN0 (PE3). Rotating the potentiometer varies the rotor voltage between 0 V and 3.3 V, allowing you to generate different analog levels and observe the corresponding ADC conversion results.

### Single ADC Channel Reading (Polling Method)

In this example, you will configure the ADC to read a single analog input channel (AIN0) using sample sequencer 3 (SS3) and turn on an LED if the voltage exceeds a certain threshold.

### Reading Internal Temperature Sensor

In this example, you will configure the ADC to read the internal temperature sensor using sample sequencer 3 (SS3) and display the temperature value on the debugger using the Watch window.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Timer-Based Temperature Measurement
Modify Example 2 so that the ADC sampling is triggered by a timer every second, instead of using continuous sampling mode. Connect an analog temperature sensor (e.g., TMP36) to an ADC input channel (such as AIN0 on PE3). Configure the ADC to read the sensor voltage on each timer trigger and calculate the corresponding temperature. Monitor the temperature values in real time by adding the variable \texttt{temp} to the Watch window in the debugger.

### Task 2: Comparing Two ADC Channels
Extend Example 2 to read two different analog inputs using separate ADC channels (e.g., AIN0 on PE3 and AIN1 on PE2) with sample sequencer 3 (SS3). Configure the ADC to use interrupts so that each conversion triggers an ISR. In the ISR, compare the two ADC values and use the result to control LEDs on GPIOF: for example, turn on the green LED if the first channel has a higher voltage, or turn on the red LED if the second channel is higher. Display both ADC values in the debugger Watch window to observe the comparison in real time.
