# Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
The ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) is a crucial component in embedded systems, allowing the conversion of analog signals into digital values that can be processed by the microcontroller. The TM4C123 microcontroller features a 12-bit ADC with multiple channels, enabling it to read various analog inputs.




## Examples
### Polling ADC
<<< @/snippets/adc/example1.c



### Interrupt-Driven ADC
<<< @/snippets/adc/example2.c


## Lab Work

1- Modify the code in part (1) above, so that a RED led is on only when the value is greater than 1000. The 
GREEN led is on only when the value is below 1000. 
 
2- Modify the code above (ADC with interrupt), so the input value and the voltage value are both displayed on 
the LCD as follow: 

```
Input Value: 767
Voltage Value: 2.474
```
