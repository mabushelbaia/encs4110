# Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
The ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) is a crucial component in embedded systems, allowing the conversion of analog signals into digital values that can be processed by the microcontroller. The TM4C123 microcontroller features a 12-bit ADC with multiple channels, enabling it to read various analog inputs.
