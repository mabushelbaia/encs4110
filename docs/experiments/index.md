# üß≠ Experiment Navigator

Welcome to the Experiment Navigator! This document serves as a guide to the various experiments and resources available for ARM assembly language programming and embedded systems development using the TM4C123G LaunchPad.
### üõ†Ô∏è ARM Assembly Language Experiments
| Experiment                                  | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  **Experiment 1: Introduction to ARM Assembly**  | Understand the basics of ARM assembly programming, including structure and syntax.              |
|  **Experiment 2: ARM Data Processing Instructions** | Learn how to perform arithmetic and logical operations using ARM instructions.                  |
|  **Experiment 3: ARM Flow Control Instructions**     | Implement control flow mechanisms such as loops and conditional execution in ARM assembly.      |
|  **Experiment 4: ARM Addressing Modes**              | Explore various ways to address memory and access data efficiently in ARM.                     |
|  **Experiment 5: ARM Subroutines**                    | Organize and modularize your code using subroutine calls in ARM assembly.                      |

Make sure to have the TM4C123G LaunchPad connected to your computer and the Keil uVision5 IDE is configured and set up for development. To set up the IDE, follow the instructions in the [Setup Guide](/setup.md).
