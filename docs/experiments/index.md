# üß≠ Experiment Navigator

Welcome to the Experiment Navigator! This document serves as a guide to the various experiments and resources available for ARM assembly language programming and embedded systems development using the TM4C123G LaunchPad.
### üõ†Ô∏è ARM Assembly Language Experiments
| Experiment                                  | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  [**Experiment 1: ARM Cortex-M4 Assembly Fundamentals**](/experiments/1)           | Learn ARM Cortex-M4 architecture, registers, memory mapping, instruction formats, and assembly programming fundamentals. |
|  [**Experiment 2: ARM Cortex-M4 Instructions and Addressing Modes**](/experiments/2) | Learn data processing, load/store instructions, conditional execution, and memory addressing modes in ARM assembly. |
|  [**Experiment 3: ARM Cortex-M4 Flow Control, Procedures, and Stack**](/experiments/3)     | Learn branching, looping, procedure calls, stack operations, and control flow in ARM assembly.      |

Make sure to have the TM4C123G LaunchPad connected to your computer and the Keil uVision5 IDE is configured and set up for development. To set up the IDE, follow the instructions in the [Setup Guide](/setup.md).
