# 🧭 Experiment Navigator

Welcome to the Experiment Navigator! This document serves as a guide to the various experiments and resources available for ARM assembly language programming and embedded systems development using the TM4C123G LaunchPad.
### 🛠️ ARM Assembly Language Experiments
| Experiment                                  | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  **Experiment 1: Data Processing and Status Flags**           | Learn how to use ARM assembly instructions for data processing and understand status flags. |
|  **Experiment 2:  Flow Control and Addressing Modes** | Learn how to implement flow control, memory access, and various addressing modes in ARM assembly.                  |
|  **Experiment 3: Stack and Procedure Calls**     | Implement stack management and procedure calls in ARM assembly.      |

Make sure to have the TM4C123G LaunchPad connected to your computer and the Keil uVision5 IDE is configured and set up for development. To set up the IDE, follow the instructions in the [Setup Guide](/setup.md).
