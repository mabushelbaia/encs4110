# Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) 

## Introduction

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is a serial communication protocol used to transmit and receive data between devices. It is widely used in embedded systems due to its simplicity and asynchronous nature, meaning no shared clock is needed between communicating devices. This makes UART highly versatile for microcontroller communication with external devices like PCs, sensors, or other microcontrollers.

In this document, we will explore UART communication using the TM4C123G microcontroller. We will cover UART concepts, configuration, and practical implementation using C. The objective is to gain a clear understanding of UART and how to program it efficiently on the TM4C123G.

**Key Topics**

1. UART Communication Basics
2. UART Configuration on TM4C123G
3. Implementing UART Initialization in C
4. Sending and Receiving Data
5. Understanding UART Registers

### UART Basics

UART allows full-duplex communication, meaning it can send and receive data simultaneously. Key elements of UART communication include:

* **Baud Rate**: The speed of data transmission measured in bits per second (bps). Examples: 9600, 115200.
* **Data Format**: Composed of data bits (usually 8), parity bit (optional), and stop bits (usually 1 or 2).
* **Start Bit**: Marks the beginning of a data frame.
* **Data Bits**: Typically 8 bits that hold the actual data.
* **Parity Bit**: Optional bit used for error detection.
* **Stop Bit**: Marks the end of the data frame.

## UART Configuration

#### Step 1: Enabling Clocks

To use UART0 and GPIOA, enable the respective clocks:

```c
SYSCTL->RCGCUART |= (1 << 0);  // Enable UART0 clock
SYSCTL->RCGCGPIO |= (1 << 0);  // Enable GPIOA clock
```

### Step 2: Configuring GPIO Pins

UART0 uses PA0 (RX) and PA1 (TX). Configure these pins for UART functionality:

```c
GPIOA->AFSEL |= (1 << 0) | (1 << 1);  // Alternate function
GPIOA->PCTL |= (1 << 0) | (1 << 4);    // UART function
GPIOA->DEN |= (1 << 0) | (1 << 1);      // Digital enable
```

### Step 3: Disabling UART0

Disabling the UART during configuration helps prevent unwanted transmissions:

```c
UART0->CTL = 0;  // Disable UART0
```

### Step 4: Setting the Baud Rate

The baud rate divisor is calculated as:

```
Baud Rate Divisor = System Clock / (16 × Baud Rate)
IBRD = Integer part
FBRD = Fractional part × 64 + 0.5
```

For a 50 MHz system clock and 115200 baud rate:

```
Baud Rate Divisor = 50,000,000 / (16 × 115200) ≈ 27.126
IBRD = 27
FBRD = (0.126 × 64) + 0.5 ≈ 8
```

Code:

```c
UART0->IBRD = 27;
UART0->FBRD = 8;
```

### Step 5: Configuring Line Control

Configure for 8 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit:

```c
UART0->LCRH = (0x3 << 5);  // 8-bit, no parity, 1 stop bit
```

### Step 6: Clock Source Selection

```c
UART0->CC = 0;  // Use the system clock
```

### Step 7: Enabling UART0

Enable UART and configure it for both transmission and reception:

```c
UART0->CTL = (1 << 0) | (1 << 8) | (1 << 9);  // Enable UART, TX, RX
```

### Step 8: Sending and Receiving Data

**Sending Data**

```c
void UART0_WriteChar(char c) {
    while ((UART0->FR & (1 << 5)) != 0);  // Wait for space
    UART0->DR = c;  // Transmit character
}
```
**Receiving Data**

```c
char UART0_ReadChar() {
    while ((UART0->FR & (1 << 4)) != 0);  // Wait for data
    return (char)(UART0->DR & 0xFF);      // Read received data
}
```

## UART Registers

### FR Register
The FR (Flag Register) indicates the status of the UART. It contains flags for various conditions:

| Bit | Name | Description              |
| --- | ---- | ------------------------ |
| 0   | CTS  | Clear to send (not used) |
| 3   | BUSY | Transmitter busy         |
| 4   | RXFE | Receive FIFO empty       |
| 5   | TXFF | Transmit FIFO full       |
| 6   | RXFF | Receive FIFO full        |
| 7   | TXFE | Transmit FIFO empty      |

### DR Register

The DR register holds the transmitted or received data. The lower 8 bits (0-7) contain the data, while the upper bits are used for error flags.


## Example Code
::: code-group
<<< @/snippets/uart/main.c
<<< @/snippets/uart/uart.c
<<< @/snippets/uart/uart.h
:::


The above code demonstrates a simple UART communication setup. The `UART0_Init` function initializes the UART0 module, while `UART0_WriteChar` and `UART0_ReadChar` functions handle data transmission and reception, respectively. To be able to communicate with the microcontroller, you can use a terminal program on your PC [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) to send and receive data over the serial port. Make sure to set the baud rate and other parameters to match the configuration in your code. The following image shows how to set up the serial connection in PuTTY:

You should replace the `COM` port with the one assigned to your TM4C123G LaunchPad. You can find this in the Device Manager under Ports (COM & LPT). The baud rate should match the one set in your code (e.g., 115200).
