## Tasks

### Task 1: Debouncing a Push Button with SysTick
Update your SysTick program so that the RED LED (PF1) toggles only when SW1 (PF4) is pressed and properly debounced.

> Use `SysTick_Config(SystemCoreClock/1000)` to generate a **1 ms** tick. Accumulate these ticks in a counter to measure longer intervals (e.g., 2000 ticks for 2 seconds).
* **Debouncing requirement:** Use the 1 ms SysTick counter to debounce SW1 (PF4) with a **150 ms** interval. When a valid press is detected (after debouncing), toggle the RED LED (PF1).

> [!Note] Hint
>  Declare global variables:
> ```c
> volatile uint32_t global_ms;
> volatile uint32_t last_ms;
> ```
> - Increment `global_ms` in the SysTick handler.
> - In the GPIOF ISR, check if `(global_ms - last_ms) >= 150` before toggling the LED and set `last_ms = global_ms;`.
### Task 2: Multiple Blinking LEDs with GPTM
Use three external LEDs alongside 3 GPTM timers to blink each LED at different intervals:
- RED LED (PF1): Blink every 250 ms
- BLUE LED (PF2): Blink every 500 ms
- GREEN LED (PF3): Blink every 1000 ms
