## Examples

The following examples illustrate the complete process of initializing Port F and controlling the on-board LEDs using Assembly language.

### Example 1: Simple LED Blink

This example initializes Port F and toggles the Red LED (PF1) on and off using address masking with a software delay.

Address Masking for PF1:
```
0x40025000 + (0x02 << 2) = 0x40025008
```

<<< @/snippets/gpio/example1.asm

### Example 2: Cycle Through RGB Colors

This example extends the previous one by cycling through RGB LED colors (Red, Green, Blue) using a software delay.

Address Masking for PF1, PF2, PF3:
```
0x40025000 + ((0x02 | 0x04 | 0x08) << 2) = 0x40025038
```

<<< @/snippets/gpio/example2.asm

## Tasks

### Task 1: Adjust the Blink Rate

Modify the delay routine in **Example 1** to change the blinking speed of the Red LED. Experiment with different delay values until the LED blinks at approximately **1 Hz** (about one second ON and one second OFF).

### Task 2: Cycle Through Multiple Colors

Expand **Example 2** to include additional colors by combining the Red, Green, and Blue LEDs. Create a program that automatically cycles through all color combinations listed in the table above.

*Hint:* Use a loop to step through the color sequence repeatedly instead of writing separate code for each color.
