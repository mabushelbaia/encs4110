# GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)

## Introduction to TM4C123G LaunchPad

The TM4C123G LaunchPad Evaluation Kit is a low-cost evaluation platform for ARM Cortex-M4F based microcontrollers from Texas Instruments. The design of the TM4C123G LaunchPad highlights the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller with a micro USB device interface and hibernation module. The EK-TM4C123GXL also features programmable user buttons and an RGB LED for custom applications.

**Features:**

- Micro AB USB port
- Onboard RGB LED
- Reset button
- Two user push buttons
- 3.3V regulator
- 16MHz main oscillator crystal
- 32.768kHz Real Time Clock (RTC) crystal
- 0-43 GPIO pins (depending on configuration)

## GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) Interface

The LaunchPad has 43 GPIO pins, each can be used as an external edge/level triggered interrupt source. The GPIO pins can be configured as digital inputs or outputs, and can be used to interface with external devices. each pin has a tolerance voltage of 5V. and each pin has a weak pull-up, pull-down and open drain.
The GPIO pins are divided into 6 ports, each port is associated with many registers that control the behavior of the pins. And they have designated addresses in the memory map of the microcontroller.

| Port Name   | Lower Address | Upper Address |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| GPIO port A | 0x40004000    | 0x40004FFF    |
| GPIO port B | 0x40005000    | 0x40005FFF    |
| GPIO port C | 0x40006000    | 0x40006FFF    |
| GPIO port D | 0x40007000    | 0x40007FFF    |
| GPIO port E | 0x40024000    | 0x40024FFF    |
| GPIO port F | 0x40025000    | 0x40025FFF    |

### LEDs and Switches on TM4C123G LaunchPad

The TM4C123G LaunchPad has 3 LEDs (Red, Blue, Green) in a single package, and 2 switches. The LEDs are connected to the GPIO pins of port F, and the switches are connected to the GPIO pins of port F as shown in the following table.

| Device   | Port | Pin  | Function |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| Red LED  | F    | 1    | Output   |
| Blue LED | F    | 2    | Output   |
| Green LED| F    | 3    | Output   |
| PUSH 1   | F    | 4    | Input    |
| PUSH 2   | F    | 0    | Input    |

## System Control - RCGCGPIO

The GPIO Run Mode Clock Gating Control register is used to enable the clock to the GPIO ports. By default all ports are disabled and must be enabled before use. Writing a 1 to a bit in the register will enable the clock to the corresponding port, and writing a 0 will disable the clock to the port.
The Least 6 bits of the RCGCGPIO register are used to control the clock gating for the 6 GPIO ports.
```c
SYSCTL->RCGCGPIO |= 0x20; // Enable clock for GPIO port F or (1<<5)
SYSCTL->RCGCGPIO |= 0x10; // Enable clock for GPIO port E or (1<<4)
```

## GPIO Registers
All the GPIO registers are 32-bit registers, but not all of the bits are used. Each bit usually corresponds to a specific pin in the port. Starting from bit 0 for pin 0 to bit 7 for pin 7.

### GPIO Direction Register (GPIODIR)

The GPIO Direction register is used to set the direction of the pins in the port. Writing a 1 to a bit in the register will set the corresponding pin to output, and writing a 0 will set the pin to input.

### GPIO Digital Enable Register (GPIODEN)

The GPIO Digital Enable register is used to enable the digital functionality of the pins in the port. Writing a 1 to a bit in the register will enable the digital functionality of the corresponding pin, and writing a 0 will disable the digital functionality.


### GPIO Pull-Up/Pull-Down Registers (GPIOPUR/GPIODR)

The GPIO Pull-Up/Pull-Down registers are used to configure the internal pull-up and pull-down resistors for the pins in the port. Writing a 1 to a bit in the GPIOPUR register will enable the pull-up resistor for the corresponding pin, and writing a 0 will disable it. Similarly, writing a 1 to a bit in the GPIODR register will enable the pull-down resistor for the corresponding pin, and writing a 0 will disable it.

### GPIO Data Register (GPIODATA)

The GPIO Data register is used to read or write the value of the GPIO pins. The GPIODATA register is a 32-bit register, each bit in the register corresponds to a pin in the port. Writing a 1 to a bit in the register will set the corresponding pin to high, and writing a 0 will set the pin to low. Reading the register will return the current value of the pins.



## Understanding the Code Structure: Setup and Main Loop

The typical GPIO program is split into **two main parts**:

1. **Setup (Initialization):**

   - Enable the clock for the GPIO port by setting the appropriate bit in the `RCGCGPIO` register.
   - Configure the pin direction using the `GPIODIR` register:
     - Set bit to `1` for output pins (e.g., LEDs).
     - Set bit to `0` for input pins (e.g., push buttons).
   - Enable the digital function for the pins you want to use via the `GPIODEN` register.
   - Configure any pull-up or pull-down resistors as needed.

   This step prepares the microcontroller hardware so that the pins behave as desired.

2. **Main Loop (Runtime Behavior):**

   - The microcontroller continuously runs this part.
   - For **outputs (e.g., LEDs):**
     - Write `1` or `0` to the corresponding bit(s) in the `GPIODATA` register to turn LEDs on or off.
   - For **inputs (e.g., buttons):**
     - Read the relevant bit(s) in the `GPIODATA` register to detect if a button is pressed or released.
   - Use delays or interrupts to control timing and responsiveness.

### Example 2:  Blinking LED using C

```c [main.c]

#define SYSCTL_RCGCGPIO_R (*((volatile unsigned long *)0x400FE608))

#define GPIO_PORTF_DATA_R (*((volatile unsigned long *)0x400253FC))
#define GPIO_PORTF_DIR_R (*((volatile unsigned long *)0x40025400))
#define GPIO_PORTF_DEN_R (*((volatile unsigned long *)0x4002551C))

#define DELAY 200000

int main(void)
{
    volatile unsigned long ulLoop;

    // Enable the GPIO port that is used for the onboard LED.

    SYSCTL_RCGCGPIO_R = 0x20;

    // Do a dummy read to insert a few cycles after enabling the peripheral.

    ulLoop = SYSCTL_RCGCGPIO_R;

    //_ Enable the GPIO pin for the LED (PF3). Set the direction as output and enable the GPIO pin for digital //function. _/

    GPIO_PORTF_DIR_R = 0x08;
    GPIO_PORTF_DEN_R = 0x08;

    // Loop for ever.

    while (1)
    {
        // Toggle  the LED.

        GPIO_PORTF_DATA_R ^= 0x08; // ^ means XOR in c

        // Delay for a bit.

        for (ulLoop = 0; ulLoop < DELAY; ulLoop++)
        {

            for (ulLoop = 0; ulLoop < DELAY; ulLoop++)
            {
            }
        }
    }
} 
```

## Tasks

### Task 1 – Change LED Color and Adjust Delay

Modify the assembly program so that the **Blue LED** blinks instead of the Green LED.

1. Increase the delay value to **2,000,000** and observe the LED blinking speed.
2. Decrease the delay value to **2,000** and observe the changes in blinking speed.

### Task 2 – Implement LED Color Sequence in C

Modify the C program to cycle through all available LED colors: **Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Magenta, Cyan, and White**.

**Requirements:**

1. Implement the delay as a separate function at the start of the code, allowing easy adjustment of the delay duration.
2. Use a loop to iterate through the LED colors to minimize code repetition.
