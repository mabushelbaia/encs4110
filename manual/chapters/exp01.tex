\section*{Experiment Overview}
This experiment introduces low-level programming on the Cortex-M4. You will build a minimal startup image, practice common data-processing and control-flow instructions, and use the \keil\ debugger to observe register and memory effects while stepping through code.

\section{Theoretical Background}
\subsection{Cortex-M4 Architecture}
\subsubsection{Registers Overview}
The Cortex-M4 architecture includes a set of general-purpose registers (R0-R12), a stack pointer (SP), a link register (LR), a program counter (PC), and a program status register (xPSR), all of which are 32-bit registers. The general-purpose registers are used for data manipulation and temporary storage during program execution. The SP is used to manage the call stack, while the LR holds the return address for function calls. The PC points to the next instruction to be executed, and the xPSR contains flags and status information about the processor state.
\paragraph{Program Status Register (xPSR)}
holds the current state of the processor, including condition flags (Negative, Zero, Carry, Overflow), interrupt status, and execution state. These flags are updated based on the results of arithmetic and logical operations, allowing for conditional branching and decision-making in programs.

\subsubsection{Memory Mapping}
The Cortex-M4 uses a flat memory model, where all memory locations are accessible through a single address space. This model simplifies programming and allows for efficient access to data and instructions. The memory is divided into several regions, including code memory (for storing instructions), data memory (for storing variables), and peripheral memory (for interfacing with hardware components). The architecture supports both little-endian and big-endian data formats, with little-endian being the default.

\subsection{Assembly Language Basics}

Assembly language is a low-level programming language that provides a direct correspondence between human-readable instructions and the machine code executed by the processor. Each instruction encodes a specific operation, such as moving data, performing arithmetic or logic, or altering control flow. Because it maps so closely to hardware, assembly allows precise control of system resources and is commonly used in performance-critical routines or when direct access to hardware is required.

Assembly programs are typically composed of three main elements: \emph{instructions}, \emph{directives}, and \emph{labels}.

\paragraph{Instructions}  
Instructions are the executable commands that the CPU carries out. Examples include data movement (\texttt{MOV}), arithmetic (\texttt{ADD}, \texttt{SUB}), logical operations (\texttt{AND}, \texttt{ORR}), and control flow (\texttt{B}, \texttt{BL}). Each instruction directly translates to one or more machine code opcodes and determines the actual behavior of the program.

\paragraph{Directives}  
Directives are commands to the assembler that guide how source code is translated into machine code but do not generate instructions themselves. Common examples include \texttt{AREA} (define a code or data section), \texttt{ALIGN} (align data to memory boundaries), \texttt{DCD} (allocate and initialize a word of storage), and \texttt{EXPORT} (export a symbol for linking). Directives organize program layout, control memory allocation, and manage symbol visibility.

\paragraph{Labels}  
Labels are symbolic names that mark specific locations in code or data. They act as targets for jumps and branches or as references for data access. Labels improve program readability and maintainability by avoiding hard-coded addresses. For instance, a label like \texttt{loop\_start} can be used as the destination of a branch instruction, and the assembler automatically computes the correct relative address.
\subsubsection{Instruction Set Overview}
The ARM Cortex-M4 instruction set is a subset of the ARMv7-M architecture, designed for efficient execution in embedded systems. It includes a variety of instructions for data processing, memory access, and control flow. Key categories of instructions include:
\hfill
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{Data Processing Instructions}: These include arithmetic operations (e.g., \texttt{ADD}, \texttt{SUB}), logical operations (e.g., \texttt{AND}, \texttt{ORR}), and data movement instructions (e.g., \texttt{MOV}, \texttt{MVN}).
    \item \textbf{Load and Store Instructions}: Instructions like \texttt{LDR} (load register) and \texttt{STR} (store register) are used to transfer data between registers and memory.
    \item \textbf{Branch Instructions}: Control flow is managed using branch instructions such as \texttt{B} (branch), \texttt{BL} (branch with link), and conditional branches like \texttt{BEQ} (branch if equal).
    \item \textbf{Special Instructions}: These include instructions for system control, such as \texttt{NOP} (no operation), \texttt{WFI} (wait for interrupt), and instructions for manipulating the stack and handling exceptions.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{General Instruction Format}

Assembly source lines generally follow this shape:

\[
\texttt{[label]} \quad \texttt{OPCODE\{<cond>\}\{S\}} \quad \texttt{operands} \quad \texttt{\color{lightgray}; comment}
\]

where curly braces \texttt{\{\}} denote optional components, and:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item \texttt{label}: optional symbolic name marking the current address.
  \item \texttt{OPCODE}: instruction mnemonic (e.g., \texttt{ADD}, \texttt{MOV}, \texttt{B}).
  \item \texttt{<cond>}: optional condition code (e.g., \texttt{EQ}, \texttt{NE}, \texttt{LT}, \texttt{GE}) that predicates execution.
  \item \texttt{S}: optional suffix indicating whether to update the condition flags (e.g., \texttt{ADDS}).
  \item \texttt{operands}: registers, immediates, or memory operands (e.g., \texttt{R0, R1, \#1} or \texttt{[R2]}).
  \item Anything after a semicolon (\texttt{;}) is a comment ignored by the assembler.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Instruction format example}]
loop_start   ADDS   R0, R0, #1      ; R0 = R0 + 1, update flags (N,Z,C,V)
             CMP    R0, #10         ; compare R0 with 10 (sets flags)
             BLT    loop_start      ; branch if R0 < 10 (uses flags)
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Conditional Execution}

Most ARM instructions can be made \emph{conditional} by appending a two-letter
\emph{condition code} to the mnemonic (e.g., \texttt{ADDEQ}, \texttt{ADDNE}).
The instruction is executed only if the condition evaluates true based on the
\texttt{xPSR} flags $N$ (negative), $Z$ (zero), $C$ (carry), and $V$ (overflow).
When no condition is supplied, the default is \texttt{AL} (always).

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{Common ARM Condition Codes}

\begin{tabularx}{0.72\linewidth}{@{}l l X@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Cond.} & \textbf{Meaning} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
EQ  & Equal                     & Execute if $Z=1$. \\
NE  & Not equal                 & Execute if $Z=0$. \\
CS/HS & Carry set / Unsigned higher or same & Execute if $C=1$. \\
CC/LO & Carry clear / Unsigned lower        & Execute if $C=0$. \\
MI  & Minus (negative)          & Execute if $N=1$. \\
PL  & Plus (non-negative)       & Execute if $N=0$. \\
VS  & Overflow set              & Execute if $V=1$. \\
VC  & Overflow clear            & Execute if $V=0$. \\
HI  & Unsigned higher           & Execute if $C=1$ \emph{and} $Z=0$. \\
LS  & Unsigned lower or same    & Execute if $C=0$ \emph{or} $Z=1$. \\
GE  & Greater or equal (signed) & Execute if $N=V$. \\
LT  & Less than (signed)        & Execute if $N\neq V$. \\
GT  & Greater than (signed)     & Execute if $Z=0$ \emph{and} $N=V$. \\
LE  & Less or equal (signed)    & Execute if $Z=1$ \emph{or} $N\neq V$. \\
AL  & Always                    & Always execute (default if no condition). \\
NV  & Never                     & Reserved / do not use. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\noindent\textit{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Using conditional-suffix mnemonics},label={lst:cond-exec}]
        CMP     R0, #0          ; set flags from (R0 - 0)
        ADDEQ   R1, R1, #1      ; if Z==1: R1++
        ADDNE   R2, R2, #1      ; if Z==0: R2++
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Barrel Shifter}
    
The barrel shifter is a hardware feature that allows …is a hardware feature that allows for efficient shifting and rotating of register values as part of data processing instructions. It can perform operations such as logical shifts (left or right), arithmetic shifts, and rotations on the second operand (\texttt{Operand2}) before it is used in the instruction without wasting extra instructions or cycles.

\noindent Examples of barrel shifter usage:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Barrel shifter examples}]
    ADD    R0, R2, R1, LSL #2    ; R0 = R2 + (R1 << 2) using barrel shifter
    SUB    R3, R4, R5, LSR #1    ; R3 = R4 - (R5 >> 1) using barrel shifter
    ORR    R6, R7, R8, ROR #3    ; R6 = R7 | (R8 rotated right by 3)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Basic Program Template (Boilerplate)}

The minimal skeleton below shows a valid vector table in a \texttt{READONLY} \texttt{RESET} area, a \texttt{READWRITE} data area for variables, and a code area with the \texttt{Reset\_Handler} entry point.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Cortex-M4 boilerplate with READWRITE data}]
        AREA    RESET, CODE, READONLY     ; Vector table lives in read-only code
        EXPORT  __Vectors                 ; Make symbol visible to the linker
__Vectors
        DCD     0x20001000                ; Initial SP value (top of stack in SRAM)
        DCD     Reset_Handler             ; Reset vector: entry address
        ALIGN        
        ; -------------------- Read-Write Data --------------------
        AREA    M_DATA, DATA, READWRITE   ; Variables go here (RAM)
        EXPORT  COUNT                     ; Export if referenced by other modules
COUNT   DCD     0                         ; Initialized RW variable (word)
BUF     SPACE   16                        ; Uninitialized RW buffer (16 bytes)

        ; -------------------- Application Code -------------------
        AREA    MYCODE, CODE, READONLY
        ENTRY
        EXPORT  Reset_Handler
Reset_Handler
        ; Example: COUNT++ and store to BUF[0]
        LDR     R0, =COUNT                ; R0 <- &COUNT
        LDR     R1, [R0]                  ; R1 <- COUNT
        ADDS    R1, R1, #1                ; R1 = R1 + 1 (update flags)
        STR     R1, [R0]                  ; COUNT <- R1        
        LDR     R2, =BUF                  ; R2 <- &BUF
        STRB    R1, [R2]                  ; BUF[0] <- (low byte of R1)
STOP    B       STOP                      ; Stay here forever
        END
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{What each directive does}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item \texttt{AREA <name>, CODE|DATA, READONLY|READWRITE}:
        defines a section. Put the vector table and program text in \texttt{CODE, READONLY};
        put variables in \texttt{DATA, READWRITE}.
  \item \texttt{EXPORT <symbol>}: makes a label visible to the linker/other modules.
  \item \texttt{DCD, DCW, DCB <values>}: allocate and initialize words, halfwords, or bytes.
  \item \texttt{SPACE <n>}: reserve \textit{n} bytes of uninitialized storage in RAM.
  \item \texttt{ALIGN}: align to a suitable boundary (commonly 4 bytes for words).
  \item \texttt{ENTRY}: mark the entry point of the image for the toolchain.
  \item \texttt{END}: end of source file.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Notes}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item The first two words in \texttt{\_\_Vectors} must be the initial stack pointer value and the address of \texttt{Reset\_Handler}.
    \item The assembler/linker places sections in appropriate memory regions based on the target device and linker script.
    \item Labels must start at the beginning of the line (no indentation), while instructions and directives should be indented for proper assembly.
    \item Variables in \texttt{READWRITE} areas are initialized to zero by default. While you can specify initial values using directives like \texttt{DCD}, the linker will place these in flash and copy them to RAM during startup, or they may be zeroed out during RAM initialization.
\end{itemize}
